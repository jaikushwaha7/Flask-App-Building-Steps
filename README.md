### Flask App Building with Python

1.  Start the app building by going to folder where you want to save code. In my case:
`D:\>cd D:\Study\Internsala\Devincept\Devincept Intership AI

D:\Study\Internsala\Devincept\Devincept Intership AI>mkdir app5

D:\Study\Internsala\Devincept\Devincept Intership AI>cd app5`

2. Created a new environment as venv
`py -3 -m venv venv`

3. Activated with the following script
`venv\Scripts\activate`

4. Installed the flask package using:
`pip install flask`

5. Written the flask code in python using spyder interface as app.py. [https://github.com/jaikushwaha7/Flask-App-Building-Steps/blob/main/app2.py].

6.  Set the flask app by connecting to app2.py and running it.
`set FLASK_APP=app2.py`
